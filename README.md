# Global-Game-Jam

# 42sh Epitech project

## Description
This project was completed in 48 hours as part of the Global Game Jam and is therefore not yet finished.
The theme was "make me laugh", so we decided to make a game where the aim was to search a computer and discover compromising information about an important person.

## Usage
```bash
sudo apt install libyaml-cpp-dev
sudo dnf install yaml-cpp yaml-cpp-devel
cmake -B build && cmake --build ./build && ./build/jam
```
